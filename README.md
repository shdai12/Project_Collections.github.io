## Welcome, this is my project the Pricing Test.

- Conduct AB testing (t-test) to determine the pricing strategy for a software product and improve the revenue by 18%
- Run chi-squared tests to address variable correlations and ensure random splitting of experimental and control groups
- Perform feature analysis to manage the tradeoff between price and volume and derive actionable insights, including launching special marketing programs and examining incompatibility issues, for subsets of users
