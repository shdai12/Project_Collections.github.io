# Welcome to my Project Collections!

## Bearmap
• Developed the back end API of a web mapping application
• Implemented an image stitching algorithm to enable zooming on the map
• Parsed a real-world dataset to construct a graph that represents the roads on the map

## Gitlet
• Implemented a version control system in Java that supports main Git features (stage, commit, branch, log) and realizes workflow tracking when engineering teams collaborate on complicated projects
• Designed methods, classes and data structures that minimize time and space complexity
• Adopted test-driven development

## Wine Quality Prediction
• Applied regression analysis to predict wine quality with its objective features (pH, acidity, etc.) with 93.5% accuracy
• Developed and evaluated OLS, ridge regression, lasso regression, and elastic net regression in predicting wine qualities
• Created 3D scientific plots to select tuning parameters that minimize cross-validation errors

## Pricing Test
• Conduct experiment design and AB testing (t-test) to determine the better price for a software product
• Run chi-squared tests to analyze user feature correlations and ensure random splitting of test and control groups
• Derive actionable insights, including launching special marketing programs and examining incompatibility issues on Linux, from user features to maximize conversion rates and revenue

## Oracle Wechat Posts
• Fetched large batches of Oracle publishing from the WeChat API and cached structured activity data in JSON format
• Analyzed sentiments of media commentaries by formatting text data with Regex and lexicon packages in Python
• Created scientific visualizations to analyze correlations and statistically significant metrics that affect article popularity

## Hydrologic Forecasting
• Maintained SQL scripts and complex queries for analysis and extraction on large-scale watershed databases
• Manipulated and visualized features and parameters with selected ML models in R for accurate hydrologic forecasting
